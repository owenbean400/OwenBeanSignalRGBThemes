# Owen Bean Signal RGB Theme

I have a built PC that has RGB colors. Signal RGB is a tool that allows for theme and customization of the RGB devices. I've spent time to create custom theme that can be shared in this repository.

## Signal RGB

Signal RGB allows for custom RGB theme customization for your PC.

- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.signalrgb.com/gettingstarted/developer-overview)

## Setup Theme

Clone repository in `Users/<user>/Documents/WhirlwindFX`, so in the end, you will need `Users/<user>/Documents/WhirlwindFX/Effects` that Signal RGB will detect.

Additionally, you can copy files in the Effects folder and paste them in your Effects folder for Signal RGB instead cloning the repo.

When the folder is placed in the correct location, there will be local effect available under `Library>Installed`. Signal RGB may need to be restarted after making folder changes.
